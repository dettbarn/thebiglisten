The project involves a regular upload of interesting hand-picked music playlists to YouTube (and potentially streaming platforms like Spotify).

As of Dec 2020, there is one playlist series, "Lockdown Distractions", which is mainly targeted at a German audience during the second national lockdown within the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the long run, the project may evolve into a music database or recommendations service across several online platforms.
